# connectfour
A simple connect-four game made in C

## How does it work?
Currently the program let the user play connect-four against another user providing a _text-based interface_.

Being a side-project it will probably be updated rarely, main features scheduled to be added include a **graphical interface** and some **code optimization**.

More challeging goals include the opportunity for the user to **play against the computer** (**easy mode**: computer's moves are random, **pro mode**: computer's moves are calculated).

Indeed, some **more test** are always welcomed.

## How do I contribute?
If you want to contribute, you can just clone this repository and modify it.

You can just *play some matches* and if you find a bug notify it or solve it yourself, you can tell us some *features you would like to see added* or even add them by yourself.

You can of course *clean ad optimize the code* if you find alternative and better ways to implement it.
